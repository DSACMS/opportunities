# HHS Inventory of Data Fellowships and Internships Mock

This page shares currently active opportunities for recurring fellowship and internships, related to data science or technology, for work in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The people of HHS are essential to its vision of making data meaningfully usable and actively used across the Department. Fellowships and internships provide a unique opportunity to learn about government work and to contribute to HHS’ mission of enhancing the health and well-being of all Americans.

The inventory includes both federal-wide programs, and programs specifically for HHS or subcomponents. Some programs are specifically focused on data science or technology, while others are broader but provide an opportunity to incorporate data-driven work.

More information about each opportunity can be found by clicking on the listing in the table. The listings can be filtered by selecting the filter icon and adding a condition.

## Limitations

This mock is currently run using an airtable account that is not publicly accessible. As a result, the job listings content within the table cannot be modified directly. 

Even though the airtable isn’t public, if you have an opportunity you’d like us to add, please file an issue https://github.com/dsacms/opportunities/issues/new on this repository following the ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md, and we’ll notify the maintainers for review.

Alternatively, you can create an independent Airtable file and replace the embed link in the index.html file to make direct updates to the mock. The instructions outlined in the Airtable Demo.docx file in the repo can provide more information on this. This new airtable account will maintain all the job listings and should be regularly managed and updated to stay up to date with all job listings information. Changes made to airtable with job listings will automatically be reflected on webpage without needing to update the code.

## Usage

This repository is meant to be used as a visual demo of how Airtable can be embedded into a webpage to clearly provide information. Changes can be made to the text and styling of the mock to fit client needs and provide a more accurate visual of the final product.

To make and view changes to these files, you can clone this repo to your device and push changes.
