# Job Opportunities Web Page Mock

Resource for Public Service Internship and Fellowship Opportunities to be made easily accessible to the public.

## Limitations

This mock is currently run using an airtable account that is not publicly accessible. As a result, the job listings content within the table cannot be modified directly. 

Even though the airtable isn’t public, if you have an opportunity you’d like us to add, please file (an issue)[https://github.com/dsacms/opportunities/issues/new] on this repository following the ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md, and we’ll notify the maintainers for review.

Alternatively, you can create an independent Airtable file and replace the embed link in the index.html file to make direct updates to the mock. The instructions outlined in the Airtable Demo.docx file in the repo can provide more information on this. This new airtable account will maintain all the job listings and should be regularly managed and updated to stay up to date with all job listings information. Changes made to airtable with job listings will automatically be reflected on webpage without needing to update the code.

## Usage

This repository is meant to be used as a visual demo of how Airtable can be embedded into a webpage to clearly provide information. Changes can be made to the text and styling of the mock to fit client needs and provide a more accurate visual of the final product.

To make and view changes to these files, you can clone this repo to your device and push changes.
